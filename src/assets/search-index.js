    content: "Life-Cycle Costing (LCC) is a forward-thinking approach to infrastructure investment. Instead of focusing solely on upfront costs, LCC considers all costs—planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and eventual disposal—over an asset's entire lifespan. LCC is at the heat of QII Principle 2, Economic Efficiency. Smarter resource allocation Better value for money Long-term economic efficiency Why Life Cycle Costing Matters Unlocking the Potential of Life Cycle Costing Too often, infrastructure projects fall into the 'Build-Neglect-Rebuild' trap—leading to inefficiencies, higher costs, and wasted resources. These can be caused by: Inadequate government budgets that fail to account for O&M costs, or a lack of funding for operations due to weak tariff/pricing. Organizational constraints holding back efficient infrastructure asset management. This can include a lack of skills, accountabilities, and unclear roles and responsibilities. The political attractiveness of building new rather than maintaining existing infrastructure. In emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), development assistance can also incentivize new projects regimes. Incorporating life cycle costing into infrastructure planning and decision-making helps break the costly cycle of short-term thinking. By accounting for the total cost of service delivery—including operations, maintenance, and eventual decommissioning—governments and institutions can make smarter investments that deliver better value over time. Building Blocks of Adopting a Life Cycle Costing approach Economic Efficiency transforms infrastructure by leveraging advanced technologies, prioritizing long-term value, and driving policy reforms for smarter procurement and sustainable outcomes. Governance Ensures accountability and institutional capacity for effective LCC implementation. Procurement Prioritizes long-term value through quality-based contracts and strategic structuring. Technical Solutions Enhances infrastructure durability and operational performance with resilience-focused strategies. Cost-recovery Sustains assets through tariffs, user fees, and performance-based financing.

    title: "Governance",
    url: "/governance",
    content: "Governance Good governance doesn't just support life-cycle costing – it's what makes it possible. Governance frameworks which facilitate LCC – inclusive of clear roles, transparent processes, and robust standards for procurement through to contract management – empower governments to prioritize long-term value, curb waste, and deliver infrastructure that lasts. When it comes to quality infrastructure investment, governance is the foundation that determines whether life-cycle costing is truly embedded in practice - or just an afterthought. To enable life-cycle costing, governance frameworks must evolve in several specific ways Clear Definition and Empowerment of Institutions and Roles – This means assigning responsibility for LCC at each stage of the infrastructure life cycle - from planning and budgeting, to procurement, delivery, and long-term maintenance. Capable, well-coordinated institutions are essential for aligning decisions with long-term value, not just short-term gains. Netherlands: DuboCalc and CO2 Performance Ladder Demonstrates how dedicated governance structures support long-term asset oversight through environmental and emissions tools. DuboCalc is a tool applied in work tenders to calculate environmental impacts. It outputs a final Environmental Cost Indicator (ECI value). An important foundation for the calculations is the underlying database, the National Environmental Database, which has a dedicated governance structure (National Environmental Database Foundation - NMD) tasked with maintaining and regularly updating the database. The CO2 Performance Ladder is a certification system with which a tenderer can show the measures taken to limit CO2 emissions both within the company and in projects, as well as elsewhere in the supply chain. The CO2 Performance Ladder is managed by an independent foundation with a defined governance structure for the tool’s operation and maintenance. Case Study Requirement for LCC at Every Step in Procedures and Standards – This includes mandating life-cycle cost analysis in project appraisal, procurement documents, and contract management. Evaluation criteria should move beyond lowest initial cost to consider the total cost of ownership and service quality over time. Bangladesh: Combined Cycle Power Plant Demonstrates how life-cycle costing was embedded across project appraisal, procurement, and contract management. Project Appraisal: LCC analysis compared technology options, selecting combined-cycle for its lower life-cycle costs despite higher initial investment, due to superior efficiency and reduced fuel consumption. Procurement: Bids required performance guarantees (e.g., net heat rate ≤6,700 kJ/kWh, output capacity 450 MW ±20 MW). Evaluation prioritized lowest life-cycle cost (initial price + NPV of fuel savings over 25 years), not lowest bid. Contract Management: Strict liquidated damages enforced accountability ($150,000 per kJ/kWh shortfall, $1M per MW deficiency), ensuring long-term performance alignment with LCC objectives. This approach justified a 17% fuel reduction versus conventional plants, demonstrating optimal life-cycle value. Strengthened Transparency and Reporting Mechanisms – Regular audits, open data on costs and performance, and clear reporting lines ensure that infrastructure decisions are evidence-based and publicly accountable. This helps prevent the “build-neglect-rebuild” cycle and supports better maintenance and asset management. Malawi: Infrastructure Data Innovations Highlights how digital platforms and inclusive oversight mechanisms enhance governance and life-cycle accountability. Malawi established the Information Platform for Public Infrastructure, an online system for centralized, digital storage and publication of infrastructure data by region and sector. The platform makes project information readily available to the public, government, and civil society. A Multi-Stakeholder Group, with representatives from government, private sector, and civil society, oversees data disclosure and publicizes findings from regular assurance reports. These mechanisms ensure transparency, evidence-based decision-making, and accountability throughout the infrastructure life cycle, helping to prevent “build-neglect-rebuild” cycles and supporting better maintenance and asset management. Effective Capacity Building – Staff and stakeholders must be trained to use LCC tools, interpret cost and performance data, and apply LCC best practices throughout the infrastructure life cycle. Building technical skills and institutional knowledge ensures that LCC is not just a policy on paper, but a routine part of how infrastructure is delivered and maintained. South Korea: Public and Private Infrastructure Investment Management Center (PIMAC) Showcases how institutional training strengthens the practical application of life-cycle costing. PIMAC, the central PPP appraisal body in South Korea, runs a robust training program for both public officials and private sector representatives. These programs are structured at two levels: Basic training provides foundational knowledge on PPP concepts and processes. Advanced training covers in-depth topics such as feasibility studies, evaluation, financial modelling, negotiation, and the integration of life-cycle costing (LCC) into project selection, procurement documentation, and contract management. These trainings ensure that public officials and private sector partners are equipped to use LCC tools, interpret cost and performance data, and apply LCC best practices throughout the infrastructure life cycle. Long-term Performance Rewarded with Incentives in Contracts – By updating regulatory frameworks to allow for innovative contracting structures, often involving the private sector in addition to sovereign entities (e.g., Performance-Based Contracts and Public-Private Partnerships), incentives such as user payments to the private party can be utilized to ensure service quality and asset condition are well maintained over the entire life cycle. India: Tamil Nadu Road Sector Project Illustrates how governance reforms can align private incentives with life-cycle performance outcomes. Performance-Based Contracts were structured to allocate life-cycle maintenance risks to contractors, with LCC calculations informing contract benchmarks and payment schedules. This governance innovation ensures that contractors are accountable for the long-term performance and cost-effectiveness of road assets, aligning private incentives with public value. By making these targeted changes in institutions, regulations, procedures, reporting, standards, and capacity, governance becomes the true enabler of life-cycle costing. This is how we ensure infrastructure investments deliver sustainable value, reliability, and efficiency for generations to come. Let’s build the governance systems that make quality infrastructure possible.

    title: "Procurement",
    url: "/procurement", 
    "content":"Procurement The procurement process sets the foundation for the economic efficiency of an infrastructure project. Procurement processes that create incentives to minimize life- cycle costs can lead to better value for money and reduce long-term expenses. Conversely, weak procurement practices, such as focusing solely on initial purchase price, can result in higher operational and maintenance costs over the asset's lifespan. The procurement of infrastructure under Public- Private Partnerships (PPPs) can be an effective way to align incentives for cost efficiency over the course of the project. This alignment will be strongest under PPPs that include an extended Operations and Maintenance (O&M) phase and where the revenues of the private sector partner are linked directly to long-term performance. Such incentives may not be as strong for infrastructure projects using public procurement. However, in such cases, the evaluation criteria for construction contracts can still be structured to encourage bidders to factor life- cycle costing into the infrastructure design. More detailed guidance on this topic can be found in the Life- Cycle Costing Guidance Note. Key procurement considerations to maximize economic efficiency include: Incentive structures – The use of PPPs and Performance-Based Contracts (PBCs) can be used to link the operator’s payments to efficient long-term performance. Vietnam: Ho Chi Minh City PCBs (World Bank) Demonstrates the use of Performance-Based Contracts (PBC) to incentivize non-revenue water reduction.

    "content":"Technical Solutions The technical solutions selected for an infrastructure project play a decisive role in determining its life-cycle cost. Adopting innovative infrastructure technologies can not only improve the quality and resilience of a project but also significantly enhance its economic efficiency. Infrastructure technologies include a broad range of new or innovative materials, machines, or digital technology solutions which can be applied during the design, construction, and Operations and Maintenance (O&M) phases to improve life cycle costs. For example, some studies estimate that around 22% of the total investment in infrastructure could be saved by minimizing cost overruns from infrastructure. Also, new analytical capabilities applied across a portfolio of assets could deliver 10–20% in savings on capital expenditure. Some examples of common uses include: Reducing construction costs – Using innovative materials, modern construction methods, and green alternatives to conventional ‘gray’ infrastructure—such as nature-based solutions—can significantly lower upfront construction costs. These approaches often reduce the need for expensive raw materials, minimize installation expenses, and accelerate construction timelines.

    "content":"Cost Recovery Identifying and accounting for all life- cycle costs during the project design stage is essential. However, this is only part of the process. Equally important is determining the method for recovering these costs throughout the infrastructure's lifespan. Options for recovering the costs of infrastructure depend on the type of project and service delivered: User fees – Where infrastructure provides direct and measurable benefits to specific users – such as electricity supply, water supply or public transport – it can be possible to recover all or partial costs through tariffs and user fees Timor-Leste: Tibar Bay Port PPP (International Finance Corporation) Demonstrates the use of a combined user-pays and government-pays model for the delivery of a port PPP in Timor-Leste.

Procurement processes that create incentives to minimize life cycle costs can lead to better value for money and reduce long-term expenses. Conversely, weak procurement practices, such as focusing solely on initial purchase price, can result in higher operational and maintenance costs over the asset's lifespan.

This alignment will be strongest under PPPs that include an extended Operations and Maintenance (O&M) phase and where the revenues of the private sector partner are linked directly to long-term performance. Assessing the vulnerability of infrastructure and the system in which they exist ensures that these systems can withstand, adapt, and recover from shocks. Vulnerability assessments identify the weak points in the system, highlighting areas where exposure to natural disasters and man-made events (such as cyber attacks) present great risks. These assessments help prioritize interventions where they are needed the most, making the best use of public and private investment. There are three main components to these analyses, including identify hazards and exposures, evaluating asset and system vulnerabilities, and apply risk-informed decision-making. This will determine how assets and systems may fail under stress and guides investment priorities to strengthen resilience and ensure reliable services. Hazards and Exposure Assessments – This involves mapping the full range of natural and man-made threats or hazards that could affect infrastructure—such as floods, droughts, earthquakes, cyberattacks—and understanding where these assets are geographically and how impacted or exposed they are to these threats. Learning from Mega-disasters: Japan Case Study Section V, Chapters 25–27 of this resource provides detailed guidance for hazard mapping and exposure assessments, covering scenario selection, risk and hazard map development, effective data management, and methods for integrating local knowledge with technical analysis to inform resilient planning and decision-making.

This alignment will be strongest under PPPs that include an extended Operations and Maintenance (O&M) phase and where the revenues of the private sector partner are linked directly to long-term performance. A resilient approach to infrastructure requires more than durable construction that withstands shocks; it involves a sequence of actions throughout design and operations that addresses not just the asset itself but also the system in which the asset exists. Applying recognized resilience standards, building adaptive operational processes, and integrating innovative digital technologies and nature-based solutions – to address both natural and man-made shocks (such as cyber-security threats) – collectively enable projects to withstand and adapt to evolving risks over their lifetime. The incorporation of resilience into the design of infrastructure assets and their operational processes can be broken down into three key categories of action: prevention, which aims to minimize damage and disruption through measures incorporated at the outset of infrastructure development; adaptation, which ensures continued performance under evolving conditions and threats; and responsiveness, which requires agile, flexible systems capable of real-time operational adjustments in the face of disaster. Prevention - Applying Resilience Standards to Planning and Design: Integrating design standards and climate considerations from the outset ensures that infrastructure design directly addresses foreseeable hazards. This proactive approach – especially when standards are applied system-wide (i.e. at a national, sector, or program level and not just project-by-project) – enables the scalable implementation of resilience interventions, including asset integrity and service continuity, in alignment with national resilience objectives. *Much of the current work on resilience standards is still nascent, especially as it pertains to infrastructure, and tends to address sustainability in a broader sense, often encompassing themes such as climate change and biodiversity, but also transparency and human rights, etc. Additionally, the prevailing guidance has been heavily influenced by financial markets and the Disaster Risk Management field. Since efforts are relatively nascent globally, users may need to reference best practice examples from more developed contexts and field of practice, and these are outlined below. Building Code Checklist for Structural Resilience The Building Code Checklist for Structural Resilience provides expert-reviewed tools to evaluate and strengthen building code provisions for structural resilience, enabling systematic embedding of prevention-oriented standards - such as hazard-resistant design and construction - across infrastructure projects and align with global best practices for resilient infrastructure planning.

Responsiveness – Ensuring Post-Event Performance of Infrastructure Assets and Systems Infrastructure practitioners and planners are increasingly recognizing the importance of integrating key resilience strategies such as redundancy, which involves alternate routes, backup capacity, and distributed assets to maintain service continuity and prevent cascading failures, as well as Functional Recovery, which sets time-bound targets for restoring essential services. Taken together, these approaches ensure that design, operations, and budgets are aligned to effectively and efficiently respond when disruptions and disasters strike. Incorporating Resilience into Infrastructure Prioritization: Application to Japan's Road Transport Sector This report presents operational methods and quantitative indicators (such as accumulated loss of functionality, redundancy metrics, and recovery time) to support infrastructure decision-makers in designing and prioritizing projects with built-in responsiveness. By measuring alternate routes, emergency access, and time-bound functional recovery, it ensures infrastructure systems are equipped to rapidly restore connectivity and essential services after disruptions and disasters, aligning design and investment with real-world performance targets. Building Back Better The Resilient Recovery section (page 18) of the report highlights how resilience strategies, particularly redundancy (like alternate routes, backup capacity, distributed assets) and Functional Recovery (setting time-bound targets for restoration of vital services), are now central to post-disaster infrastructure planning. These approaches align design, operations, and budgets to maintain or rapidly restore service continuity, prevent cascading failures, and enable effective, efficient disaster response. Together, they ensure infrastructure systems are both responsive and robust when disruptions strike, guiding practitioners to prioritize investments that maximize resilience throughout the asset lifecycle. Functional Recovery of Lifeline Infrastructure System Services This NIST publication provides authoritative guidance on setting and implementing functional recovery targets for critical infrastructure systems, detailing engineering, operational, and policy strategies to ensure post-disaster service restoration within defined timeframes. Section 4 specifically outlines performance objectives and approaches for achieving rapid, reliable functional recovery, supporting practitioners to align design, operations, and investment priorities with resilience goals for lifeline infrastructure. OECD Infrastructure Toolkit: Strengthening Critical Infrastructure Resilience This online toolkit frames resilience with an “all-hazards system-based approach,” aimed at maintaining service continuity despite diverse threats. It underscores strategies for systemic rebound and includes practical case studies. Building Resilience: New Strategies for Strengthening Infrastructure Resilience and Maintenance This paper emphasizes designing infrastructure investments to not just address immediate needs but also ensure long-term functioning across an asset’s lifecycle. It approached infrastructure planning from a functional recovery perspective and provides a strategic framework for optimizing both existing and new infrastructure against future shocks."

    content: "Financing Resilience The procurement process sets the foundation for the economic efficiency of an infrastructure project. Procurement processes that create incentives to minimize life cycle costs can lead to better value for money and reduce long-term expenses. Conversely, weak procurement practices, such as focusing solely on initial purchase price, can result in higher operational and maintenance costs over the asset's lifespan. The procurement of infrastructure under Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) can be an effective way to align incentives for cost efficiency over the course of the project. This alignment will be strongest under PPPs that include an extended Operations and Maintenance (O&M) phase and where the revenues of the private sector partner are linked directly to long-term performance. Financing resilient infrastructure is constrained by limited resources, weak public policy alignment, lack of data on costs and benefits, and risk perceptions. Public budgets are often overstretched, making it hard to fund resilience measures that require higher upfront costs but yield long-term benefits. Standard screening and appraisal processes seldom capture these benefits, so resilience projects are often undervalued compared to conventional infrastructure. Overcoming these barriers requires embedding resilience into infrastructure financing frameworks and deploying innovative financing instruments. Systematic risk screening and appraisal can also ensure resilience benefits are captured, quantified, and used to prioritize investments. Screening projects with sustainability standards – Alongside the vulnerability and risk assessments (outlined within the ‘Diagnosing Vulnerabilities’ sub-page of QII.4), projects can also be screened against international sustainability and resilience standards. Meeting these standards shows investors that a project meets certain ‘sustainable and resilient’ criteria, which can unlock new funding sources—including from private investors—that are often out of reach for these kinds of infrastructure projects. *The below list highlights references, which aggregate global best practices across multiple sectors. For a deeper dive into the topic, please refer to the ‘Resilient Design and Operations’ sub-page. Climate Bonds Initiative EU Taxonomy Compass FAST-Infra Label Valuing resilience through life cycle costing - Infrastructure should be assessed on its full life-cycle costs, not just upfront spending. In particular, by factoring in the cost of long-term climate and disaster risks, decision-makers can see how an upfront investment in resilience today can avoid large repair and replacement costs in the future.

As economies and societies become increasingly digital, cybersecurity risks are rising in tandem. Essential infrastructure services—such as energy and transport networks—now rely on interconnected digital systems and technologies that increase their exposure to cyber threats. Strengthening cybersecurity is therefore fundamental to infrastructure resilience. The QII Partnership is at the forefront of integrating cybersecurity into infrastructure design and investment, working with governments and partners to assess risks, build capacity, and mainstream cyber resilience to ensure that critical infrastructure systems remain safe, trusted, and future-ready.
