Evaluation prioritized lowest life-cycle cost (initial price + NPV of fuel savings over 25 years), not lowest bid. Contract Management: Strict liquidated damages enforced accountability ($150,000 per kJ/kWh shortfall, $1M per MW deficiency), ensuring long-term  performance  alignment  with LCC objectives.
